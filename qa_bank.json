Value is often seen as intrinsic or derived directly from physical properties or labor input, rather than subjective and context-dependent. May struggle with the idea that 'cost' isn't just accounting cost or physical resources used.",

          "You spend 4 hours meticulously debugging code for Project A. Could that time have been spent advancing Project B, which has an earlier deadline? How do you *quantify* the cost of that debugging session in terms of Project B's progress? Is that cost fixed or does it depend on the potential outcome of Project B?",
